REFLECTION

1. How long it took you to complete the task.
- It took me almost 3 hours to finish the task. 


2. Reflect on any challenges or areas of confusion and how you resolved them.
-The most challenging part was placing the search icon inside the input element to match the given design. 
I researched and learned about CSS positioning, specifically relative and absolute, which allowed me to overlap elements correctly. 
I also struggled with centering the search bar in the header, but after making a few adjustments with Flexbox, 
I was able to align it properly.
