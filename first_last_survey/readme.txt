1. How long it took you to complete the task.
- It took me almost 30 minutes to finish the task. 


2. Reflect on any challenges or areas of confusion and how you resolved them.
- I was confused because my radio buttons allowed multiple selections at once. 
I realized later that for radio buttons to act as a single-choice group, the name attribute must be same for every option in that set.
- I was also unsure how to create the border surrounding the questions. After researching, I discovered the <fieldset> and <legend> tags, 
which are specifically designed to group form elements with a labeled border.
