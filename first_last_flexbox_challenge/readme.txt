RELFECTION:

1. How long it took you to complete the task.
- It took me about an hour to complete the task. 

2. Reflect on any challenges or areas of confusion and how you resolved them.
- I initially had trouble thinking which flexbox properties to use to achieve the design.
Since the parent container already had display: flex, I focused on adjusting child 
properties like width, flex, alignment, and padding to ensure the boxes layout correctly.
