<!-- 
RELFECTION:

1. How long it took you to complete the task.
- It took me over an hour to complete the task. 

2. Reflect on any challenges or areas of confusion and how you resolved them.
- I struggled at first to get the aside and section to sit side-by-side using Flexbox.
 Then I realized I needed to set the main container to display flex and that resolved the issue.
