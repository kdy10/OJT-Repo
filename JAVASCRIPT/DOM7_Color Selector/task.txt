Click a color button. What happens?
- When I click a color button, two alerts appear. The first says "You clicked the Red Button," followed immediately by a second alert saying "You clicked the container."


Uncomment event.stopPropagation(); inside the button click handler.
Click a color button again. What changed?
- After uncommenting event.stopPropagation(), only one alert appears which is "You clicked the Red Button."


Explain in your own words why event.stopPropagation() is useful in this example.
- When we click a button inside a container, we are technically clicking the container as well. This happens because JavaScript events 'bubble up' to parent elements. 
In this example, we use event.stopPropagation() to prevent the button's event from triggering the events attached to the container or other parent elements.
